# Dashboarder

## Overview

Dashboarder is a modern web dashboard developed to showcase my expertise in using React and Javascript. 
Asides from Day.js being used to handle date formatting and Google Chart used to display charts, all 
functionality and animation is built without the use of any other third party libraries.

Built with Javascript, React.js, Day.js, Google Chart
